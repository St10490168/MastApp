- Date: 15 January 2025
- Evidence: Used for brainstorming optimal file organization and component architecture patterns

 Section 2: Input Validation Patterns
- Tool: Claude AI (Anthropic, Version 3.5)
- Purpose: Brainstorming validation approaches and error handling strategies
- Date: 15 January 2025
- Evidence: Discussed best practices for form validation and user feedback patterns

Important Notes on AI Usage

What AI Was Used For:
- Brainstorming: Discussing project structure approaches
- Best Practices: Learning about validation patterns and error handling

What AI Was NOT Used For:
- Code Generation: All code was written by me based on my understanding
- Copy-Paste Solutions: No code was directly copied from AI responses
- Problem Solving: All logic and implementation decisions were my own
- Debugging: All troubleshooting and testing was done independently

My Understanding and Ownership:
- I can explain every line of code in my project
- All implementation decisions were made by me
- I understand the React Native concepts and patterns used
- The code reflects my learning and application of course materials

Adaptation Process:
1. Discussed concepts with AI to understand best practices
2. Researched official documentation for React Native and Expo
3. Implemented solutions based on my understanding of requirements
4. Tested and refined code through my own debugging process
5. Added personal comments explaining my logic and decisions

This disclosure ensures complete transparency about AI assistance while confirming that all code implementation, logic, and understanding are my own original work.
